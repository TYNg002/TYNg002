### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
#### I'm new to programming, but always eager to learn! I love making things!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve recently completed a Python-focussed UK Department for Education-funded Software Engineering bootcamp.

ðŸŒ± I'm now teaching myself Android Studio and Kotlin, and practicing Python on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

âš¡ Fun fact: I have quite the creative side to me - I do pottery and watercolour, and also perform in dance.
