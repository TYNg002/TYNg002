### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
#### I'm new to programming, but always eager to learn! I love making things!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing up a UK Department of Education-funded Software Engineering bootcamp.

ðŸŒ± I'll then be looking into the differences between different C languages and delving further into a second language.

âš¡ Fun fact: I have quite the creative side to me - I do pottery and watercolour, and also perform in dance.
